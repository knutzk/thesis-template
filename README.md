# PhD thesis template

This repository contains a template for a PhD thesis.
The typesetting and format is adjusted to the requirements at the University of GÃ¶ttingen / GAUSS, but can in principle be adapted very quickly.

The `tex` subfolder the chapters of the thesis.
In addition, the main folder contains the following files necessary for compilation:

- `dissertation-bib.bib`: bibliography file for biblatex/biber
- `dissertation-defs.sty`: custom definitions (i.e. tex commands) used throughout the thesis
- `dissertation.tex`: the main document
- `ktxbbltx.sty`: package definition file for a custom bibliography format
- `ktxthss.cls`: class file used for the thesis

Compilation was tested with texlive 2018 and newer and worked in all scenarios.


## Requirements

The class file and bibliography configuration rely on the *basic scheme* of the texlive 2018 distribution plus the following packages:

- koma-script   -- A bundle of versatile classes and packages
- l3kernel      -- latex3 programming conventions (dependee: siunitx)
- l3packages    -- High-level latex3 concepts (dependee: siunitx)
- leading       -- Define leading with a length
- lm            -- Latin modern fonts in outline formats

## Compiling the thesis

With all necessary requirements installed, the thesis can be compiled with:
```bash
pdflatex dissertation.tex
biber dissertation
pdflatex dissertation.tex
pdflatex dissertation.tex
```

## Setup in a docker image

The dissertation comes with a docker configuration file that includes the necessary texlive 2018 *basic scheme* plus the above list of packages.
The image build instructions are based on ubuntu 16.04.
The docker image is published on docker hub, but can also be generated with 
```bash
docker build -t knutzk/latex-basic:v0.1 .
```
