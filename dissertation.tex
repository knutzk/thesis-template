% Abstracts in English and German. Choose whatever you consider
% appropriate. My personal thoughts are (assuming the thesis is
% written in English): if the title page is in German, go with
% German and English abstracts (in this order). If the title page
% is English already, the English abstract should follow
% immediately, and the German abstract can be dropped.
